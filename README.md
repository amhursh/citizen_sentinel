# Citizen Sentinel

We all know the political issues that are important to us, but most of us are not able to track the actual legislation that affects those issues. News media is necessarily scope limited, so we don't see every legislative action that affects us. Raw data is nearly impossible for the layman to parse and relate to the issues we prioritize. Americans are thus disconnected from one of the most important features of civic society: law-making.

Citizen Sentinel will provide a centralized, easy-to-use interface that any american can use to track historical and current legislative action. Users can select issues of concern and representatives of their choice, and get clear, easy to understand information and analytics on those issues and reps.
